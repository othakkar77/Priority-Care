 * This enumeration defines the set of the predefined constants to determine the triage level of a

 * TriageLevel constants are comparable. <BR/>
 * References of type TriageLevel can be compared using the Comparable.compareTo() method. For
 * instance:<BR/>
 * If we consider the following references. <BR/>
 * TriageLevel red = TriageLevel.RED; <BR/>
 * TriageLevel yellow = TriageLevel.YELLOW; <BR/>
 * TriageLevel green = TriageLevel.GREEN; <BR/>
