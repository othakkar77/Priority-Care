# Priority-Care
This project implements a priority queue for patient intake at an urgent care clinic using a min-heap data structure. It supports adding and removing patients based on triage level priority where triage levels are defined using an enum. The PatientRecord class implements Comparable to enable ordering in the min heap. The PriorityCareAdmissions class provides the priority queue implementation using an array-based min heap. The PriorityCareTester class contains a testing suite to validate correctness. The CareAdmissionsDriver provides an interactive command line interface to simulate adding patients, viewing the queue, and marking patients as seen. The compareTo method in PatientRecord defines the ordering by triage level. The PriorityCareAdmissions methods like add, peek, percolateUp, and percolateDown to implement the priority queue. The PriorityCareTester validates the correctness of all data structure operations.
